## Overview and Origin

Open banking is a method by which companies are able to offer safe exchange between established banks and third party service providers. By using Application Programming Interfaces (API's), a service provider can integrate their payment, investment tool, or any applicable finance application with all banks.

This case study will focus on the company named TIBCO. TIBCO was founded in 1997 by Vivek Ranadive. The name was derived from a description of the company's initial product (The Information Bus Company). The product it initially offered was software designed to communicate the activities of the financial markets in real-time without any human interaction. The idea was founded on the enhanced use of APIs to unlock financial data. The company was originally a subsidiary of a venture capitalist firm called Reuters Holdings. TIBCO success also followed its inclusion as one of the initial partners with Microsoft to deliver "push" technology to provide news and data for free through internet browsers. From there it has continued to flourish and expand through acquisitions.

After a going public in 1999, the company was acquired in 2014 by Vista Equity Partners and is now privately owned.

## Business Activities

Specifically with Open Banking, TIBCO is looking to enable its customers, usually large scale banks with the tools to stay current and attract new development. The benefits of Open Banking is typically a merging of the interests between traditional banks with a broad customer base and startups that have the agility to create competitive tools. As a result, finance consumers get customer centric tools, efficient use of data and enhanced trust as the technology rapidly changes.

The intended user would be banks that are looking to expand their customer base or strengthen their customer base with new advancements. According to a PwC [study](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/next-in-banking-capital-markets-trends.html?WT.mc_id=CT7-PL900-DM1-TR1-LS4-ND30-PRG7-CN_DataAndAnalyticsBuilds-NextInBakingCapitalMarketsTrendNativeNativo), across all US banks , consumers bring in slightly more than half of all revenue. Fintech will continue to drive customer expectations. So as opposed to growth through bank acquisitions, large banks could be challenged to focus on customer centric solutions that open banking might allow.

TIBCO has a substantial [history](https://www.tibco.com/resources/analyst-report/gartner-magic-quadrant-master-data-management-solutions) of enabling large enterprises access their operational data. It has a clear advantage because it has been a proven solution for large scale customers such as Vodafone, Delta Airlines. One of their methods that makes, TIBCO unique is that they use a process known as data virtualization
